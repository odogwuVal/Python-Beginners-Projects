Sometimes we want the computer to pick a random number in a given range, pick a random element from a list, 
pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin, etc. The random module provides access to functions that support 
these types of operations. One such operation is random.choice() method (returns a random item from a list, tuple, or string.) 
that we are going to use in order to select one random word from a list of words that weâ€™ve created.
